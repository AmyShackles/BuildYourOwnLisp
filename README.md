# Build Your Own Lisp Interpreter in C

Working through http://buildyourownlisp.com/contents


If you'd like to use this Lisp interpreter, the most recent working version can be found in the Chapter 14 folder.

To use the interpreter:
1. Fork/clone repo
2. Cd into most recent working version's folder(currently Chapter 14)
3. Compile most recent working version (currently lisp.c)
4. Run program (./lisp.c)


Recommend compiling using the command `cc -std=c99 -Wall lisp.c ../mpc.c -ledit -lm -o lisp`
